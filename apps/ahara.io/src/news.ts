    date: '2026-01-09',
    content: `After months of rigorous hot sauce consumption (someone had to do it), Scorchbook is officially production-ready. The app now features delete and rerun capabilities for those unfortunate moments when the AI mistakes your artisanal ghost pepper reduction for ketchup. We've also polished the UI to be as smooth as a well-aged habanero ferment. Your tongue may burn, but at least your app experience won't.`,

    title: 'The Canonry: Now Generating Histories for Domains That Don\'t Exist Yet',
    date: '2026-01-08',
    content: `Lore Weave has reached a new milestone in procedural history generation. The framework now supports fully domain-agnostic worldbuilding, meaning you can generate elaborate fictional histories for anything from penguin civilizations to sentient furniture empires. The growth template system has been refined, the simulation engine optimized, and the graph explorer made sufficiently hypnotic. Whether you're building lore for a game, novel, or just enjoy watching procedurally generated drama unfold, we've got you covered.`,

    title: 'Penguin Tales: 200+ Penguins Can\'t Be Wrong',
    date: '2026-01-08',
    content: `The definitive penguin history experience is here. We've generated over 200 unique penguin portraits, each one a distinguished member of their fictional civilization. The archive now contains 30+ in-universe documents ranging from imperial decrees to philosophical treatises on fish. Is it historically accurate? No. Is it penguinically accurate? We've decided that's not a word, but also yes. Built on The Canonry framework, Penguin Tales serves as both a showcase and a warning about what happens when procedural generation meets an unhealthy obsession with flightless birds.`,

    date: '2025-12-22',
    content: `The persistent multiplayer narrative experiment continues. Players can now embark on solo GPT-guided adventures that feed back into a shared world state. Your questionable decisions in the wasteland will echo through the news feeds and faction standings of other players. The quest log has been implemented, the map overlay refined, and the inventory system no longer occasionally deletes your hard-earned gear. We call that progress. Welcome to the post-apocalypse - it's collaborative now.`,

    date: '2025-12-20',
    content: `The philosophical CAPTCHA alternative has been updated with new existential challenges. Human Mode now features questions that will make you question your own humanity, while Cat Mode has been calibrated to accept responses from actual cats (results may vary). We've found that asking users to contemplate the nature of consciousness is surprisingly effective at filtering bots. Or maybe the bots are just having an existential crisis. Either way, mission accomplished.`,

    date: '2025-12-17',
    content: `The clipboard manager for people who take copy-paste seriously. This release adds MIDI controller support, because apparently some of you want to DJ your clipboard history. The new onscreen slot GUI makes it easier to see what's in your paste arsenal at a glance. Still lightweight, still fast, still doing one thing well. We've resisted the urge to add blockchain integration. You're welcome.`,
